![[Pasted image 20210613143553.png]]
Mobile garbage bin
	- United States brand name "Dumpster"
	- Similar to rubbish skip
Important information is thrown out with the trash
	- Thanks for bagging your garbage for me!
Gather details that can be used for a different attack
	- Impersonate names, use phone numbers
Timing is important
	- Just after end of month, end of quarter
	- Based on pickup schedule
	
## Legality
In the United States, it's legal
	- Unless there's a local restriction
If it's in the trash, it's open season
-	Nobody owns it
Dumpsters on private property or "No Trespassing" signs may be restricted
	- You can't break the law to get to the rubbish
There are several places with grey areas due to the local laws or policies, so if there are any questions on the legality, the best thing to do is to talk to a legal professional.

## Mitigation
- Secure your garbage
	- Fence and lock
- Shred your documents
	- This will only go so far
	- Governments burn the good stuff
