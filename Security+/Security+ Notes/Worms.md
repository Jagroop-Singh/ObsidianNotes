#SelfReplicating
Worms are malware that can replicate itself, unlike virus's which need a host computer or operating system, a worm program operates alone. The worm is often transmitted via file-sharing networks, information-transport features, email attachments, or by clicking links to malicious websites.

Firewalls and IDS/IPS can mitigate many worm infestations, though they don't help much once the worm gets inside
